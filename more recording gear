the above drum, but able to route some of the drums to a march, lell, rokton uds
maybe a moog dfam rack synth as a another possible alternative to route some drums too for infinite sound possibilities
maybe a roland seo2 analog synth module
an arp
a prophet
and a memeorymoog on account of i cant remember anything so maybe a memory moog will help (its a good synth)


and i need all animal noises, forest noises, and industrial noises sampled and maybe emulated for recording some meditation or relaxation music
and the last one is like an elektron digikat drum computer and sampler
and spare parts, extra drum pads, and extra kick drums too,

I play metal and dance music, i need something serious to play with. and rubber so i can have quiet time while i play the drum, and play loud when i want
and bash my drums and fight them because thats what i do. 

it may or may not seem expensive to you all, but i develop this stuff and will come up with a lot of analog/digital compatible interfaces and
develop these products so that everyone has something to play with in a few years.
